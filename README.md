## Password Protect lets you easily hide content in any post or page behind a safe and secure password.

No complex membership system required.

### Simple Password Protection

Just select the content you'd like to hide (it can be a video, audio track, paragraph, answer or anything else at all), click on the lock button and select a password that must be entered. Once activated  you'll see a nice new 'Password Protect' icon added to your Visual editor that you can use to password protect selected content.

 That little lock is all you need

 Simply select the content you want to protect and enter the password you'd like to use. You can even easily edit or change it at a later date.

 Fun game... guess the password

 Protected content will prompt users to enter a password for access to your content.

### Protect Just About Anything

You can protect any media, shortcodes inserted by other plugins or any other digital item you'd like - if it can be inserted into a post or page, it can be protected. Plus, multiple separate pieces of content can be protected in a single post or page. An excellent tool for:

*   Teachers wanting to keep work private from everyone who isn't in their class (or student group)
*   Bloggers wanting to limit access to content to only people they know
*   Providing special giveaways, but only to people who you give, or who can guess the password
*   Or anyone looking to secure a piece of content, rather than a whole page

Use Password Protect for a simple content protection solution.

 On the front end, entering the password works the same as post passwords, it's stored in an encrypted cookie for 10 days.
